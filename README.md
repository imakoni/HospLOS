SQL - Hospital Length of Stay Analysis
This project provides an analysis of hospital admissions and discharges over four weeks to identify patients at risk of exceeding the expected length of hospitalization. Patients staying beyond the expected duration face increased risks of hospital-acquired infections and higher costs. Identification of the factors influencing the length of stay is essential for developing effective interventions.
